# Paginating Drawers

Paris contains a mechanism for creating pagination within a single surface. This is useful for complex or multi-step processes that would otherwise require a lot of scrolling or complicate the UI.

> This API currently supports `Drawer`, and will soon be expanded to support pagination of any surface.

## Usage

Paris provides a hook for pagination called `usePagination`. This hook functions as a router that allows you to control pagination state and navigate between pages.

To enable pagination:

1. Instantiate a pagination router using `usePagination`.
2. Pass the pagination object to the Drawer using the `pagination` prop.
3. Pass your pages as children to the Drawer. Each must have a key that is unique across all pages, which can then be passed to `pagination.open` to navigate to that page.

The pagination object returned by `usePagination` has the following properties:

- `open`: A function that takes a page key and navigates to that page.
- `currentPage`: The key of the current page.
- `history`: An array of page keys that are currently in the navigable history stack.
- `back`: A function that navigates to the previous page.
- `forward`: A function that navigates to the next page.
- `canGoBack`: A boolean indicating whether the user can go back.
- `canGoForward`: A boolean indicating whether the user can go forward.

The hook creates a shared state object between your parent component and the drawer. This means that you can use the `pagination` object's methods to control the drawer from your parent component, or from pages passed to the drawer.

## Example

```tsx
import { Drawer } from 'paris/drawer';
import { Button } from 'paris/button';
import { usePagination } from 'paris/pagination';

const MyComponent = () => {
    const pages = ['page1', 'page2', 'page3'] as const;

    const pagination = usePagination<typeof pages>('step1');

    return (
        <Drawer
            title="User creation flow"
            open={true}
            onClose={() => {}}
            // Pass the entire pagination object to the Drawer to enable pagination
            pagination={pagination}
        >
            <div key={pages[0]}>
                Page 1
                <Button
                    onClick={() => {
                        // Navigate to the next page using `open`
                        pagination.open('page2');
                    }}
                >
                    Next Page
                </Button>
            </div>
            <div key={pages[1]}>
                Page 2
            </div>
            <div key={pages[2]}>
                Page 3
            </div>
        </Drawer>
    );
};
```
